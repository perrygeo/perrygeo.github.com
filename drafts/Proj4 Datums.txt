While I agree that open source tools are totally capable with regard
to datum shifts, this was not always the case a few years ago:

tl;dr; It's more than just math - there are tradeoffs between
different datum transforms that a  small percentage of users might
really care about. PROJ.4 used to make some pretty dangerous
assumptions about datum transformations and didn't allow you to select
the datum transformation method. But the community was aware of the
implications and now we've got the ability to choose a datum transform
and have a sensible technique for determining defaults.


Constrast that with ESRI's approach of choosing the default datum
transform based on list order. For the NAD27 to WGS84 transform, it
gives default to one of the absolute worst options as the first one in
the list is only appropriate for the Caribbean and is horribly suited
for most of North America! But there is little accessible
documentation on which datum transforms are appropriate and why you
would choose one over the other... so most users happily accept the
default and produce data that is essentially garbage from the
standpoint of coordinate accuracy.


Ultimately I'll take the open source approach any day knowing that
nothing is hidden; problems and assumption (like the proj.4 issue in
Frank's blog post above) are completely out in the open and thus under
your control.
