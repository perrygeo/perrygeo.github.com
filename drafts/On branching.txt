building a clients features into an existing tool is bound to do neither very well. There is always a compromise between maintaining the existing application and extending it to fit a particular user's needs.
 
Look at application specific hooks in MS windows code: One one hand, the level of commitment to backwards compatibility is what made them successful. on the other hand, it's what prevents them from innovating.
 
developing the functionality for the client is an entirely different endeavor than integrating that functionality with an exiting application.
 
along the lineage of an application lifetime, you have a commitment to maintaining existing functionality yet that commitment can constrain how much you can innovate on a particular topic. Better to branch, see what sticks, merge the best ideas from the branch (they;ve already been developed and tested, just need to be integrated).
