Starts with someone developing their own solution. Shares that solution with the world. Realizes that proprietary “Intellectual Property” would slow adoption, open source will:
* get feedback
* get collaborators
* Innovative but acknowledges the works of others that came before. 
* scale it beyond the capacity of the original creator
* allows solution to propagate and mutate independently of the original “brand name”
   * disadvantage: can’t control or restrict use for monetization.
   * advantage: higher uptake, massive scaling, leveraging unforeseen adjacent possibilities
* less focus on sales; proof is in the pudding, merit-based
* encourages acknowledging shortcomings and transparency
* licensing: copyleft (protects ideas from becoming proprietary) vs permissive (protects authors from liability and restrictions)
* establish author as an expert = potential consulting revenue


Github specifically implements this 
* forks
* social: follow/star
* pull-requests
* tickets
* comments
* networks
