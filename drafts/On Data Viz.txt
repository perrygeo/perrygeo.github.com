Most successful projects I've worked on in my professional career that have culminated in unique ways of visualizing data were developed from the AH HA! moment. Not from a top-down need to develop the capacity for it's own sake but from a deep, bottom-up, organic understanding of the data that lead to breakthroughs in thinking that could be represented visually. It's very hard to plan and budget for that kind of innovation.


Also, I'd say that good #dataviz is dependent on a deep understanding of the data and not so much on the actual tools used to implement it.


So a project should probably focus on exploring a particular problem in unique ways rather than a general technology capacity approach.

Tools do allow innovative visualizations but never forget that good viz is dependent on deep understanding of the data.
