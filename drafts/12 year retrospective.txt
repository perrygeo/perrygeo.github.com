Thirteen years ago today, I delved into the world of GIS as part of my Natural Resources Management degree. Here’s what I’ve learned:


1) It’s not all about “geo”. Time, semantics, analytical assumptions, domain knowledge and a fundamental understanding of the data are often more important than location. 


2) There is a personal choice to be made: Are you acting as a data analyst (the product is a synthesis of knowledge derived from information) or as a tool builder (the product is a tool that allows others to derive knowledge from information)?


3) Writing code is a prerequisite regardless of your choice on #2.


4) There is no such thing as “done”, “finished” or “final”. There is only the current state and a vision for the future.


5) “Work, don’t worry”: obsessive planning will not yield results. Making forward progress will. 


6) … But don’t simply forge ahead making tracks in the wrong direction; plan and worry *as necessary* to steer the ship.


7) If #5 and #6 seem at odds, you might be lacking perspective and/or real-world experience.


8) The only thing preventing true collaboration between disciplines is a mis-understanding of vocabulary.


9) Like student loan, sometimes it is worth taking on some technical debt (i.e. hacking together a solution that may be less than elegant). Also like a student loan, that debt will hang over you for years until you pay it off.


10) Iterative development is the only way. If your goal is reaching the moon, try building a paper airplane first and see what you learn.


11) Most of the greatest technological and scientific innovations never get published.


12) Almost no failures get published; we need more of those
