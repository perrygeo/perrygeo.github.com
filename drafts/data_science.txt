        age of scare data and clever mathmatics to extract knowledge...
        ... age of ubiquitous data and new workflows to extract knowledge.
        "janitor work" - data wrangling is 50-80% (citation?)
        Big data: volume, velocity and variety (difficult data)
        incompatible formats, structure and semantics
        mashups: using data for other than its intended purpose 
            (some data collected for no specific reason)
        90% of science is handling data! Data munging is a big opportunity
        Pulling meaning out of data is a new method of scientific inquiry
            1st empirical, 2nd theory, 3rd computational, 4th data
        Prep data, run model, interpret results
