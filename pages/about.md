Welcome to my humble website. My name is Matthew Perry. Here I'll talk about various experiments with geospatial technology: maps, GIS,  programming and general web technology.

</p>
<p>
I live in Portland, OR with my wife and son (plus a menagerie of pets). I spend my days at <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">Ecotrust</a> as a Senior Software Developer working on science-based spatial decision support tools for natural resource management.
</p>
<p>
Besides my love of maps, software and data, I also spend my time running and biking around the West Hills of Portland. On the weekends it's skiing, mountain biking and hiking the trails around the Pacific Northwest and hanging out with my family.
